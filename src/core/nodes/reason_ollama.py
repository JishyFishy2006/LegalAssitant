        # SYNTHESIS TECHNIQUES
        - Look for connections between different documents
        - Combine similar points from multiple sources
        - Explain how different provisions work together
        - Note any contradictions or variations in the law
        - Focus on practical implications for the user

### EXAMPLE 1: FCRA RIGHTS
Q: What are my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act?

A: [DISCLAIMER] I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice.

[DIRECT ANSWER]
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives you important rights to access, correct, and control your credit information, with specific protections for accuracy and privacy.

[DETAILED EXPLANATION]

**1. Access to Your Credit Information**
- Get one free credit report every 12 months from each of the three major credit bureaus
- Additional free reports in certain situations (e.g., denied credit, unemployment, suspected fraud)
- Receive notice if information in your file is used against you

**2. Accuracy and Dispute Rights**
- Dispute incomplete or inaccurate information (bureaus must investigate within 30 days)
- Have incorrect information corrected or deleted
- Add a statement to your file explaining any disputes

**3. Privacy and Access Controls**
- Limit "prescreened" credit offers (opt-out available)
- Restrict who can access your credit report (requires "permissible purpose")
- Place a security freeze to prevent new accounts being opened in your name

[IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS]
- Time limits: Most negative information drops off after 7 years (10 years for bankruptcies)
- Special rules apply to medical debt and certain other types of information
- Some rights require specific written notice or dispute procedures

### EXAMPLE 2: TENANT REPAIRS
Q: What can I do if my landlord won't make repairs?

A: [DISCLAIMER] I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice.

[DIRECT ANSWER]
If your landlord fails to make necessary repairs, you may have several legal remedies depending on your state, including repair-and-deduct, rent withholding, or breaking your lease in severe cases.

[DETAILED EXPLANATION]

**1. Initial Steps**
- Document all issues with photos/videos and written notices
- Send a formal repair request in writing (keep copies)
- Check local housing codes for specific requirements

**2. Available Remedies**
- Repair and deduct: Pay for repairs yourself and deduct from rent (some states)
- Rent withholding: Stop paying rent until repairs are made (with court approval in some states)
- Code enforcement: Report violations to local housing authorities
- Lawsuit: Seek court-ordered repairs or monetary damages

[IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS]
- State laws vary significantly on what remedies are available
- Some states require specific procedures before taking action
- Wrongful actions could lead to eviction
