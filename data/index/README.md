# Index Directory

This directory stores the FAISS index and its associated metadata.

## Contents:
- `faiss.index`: The main FAISS vector index file, containing the embeddings of all document chunks.
- `meta.sqlite`: An SQLite database that stores metadata for each chunk, including its ID, source document, and text content.

## Generation:
- These files are generated by the `build_index.py` script.
- They should not be manually edited.

## Purpose:
- The `faiss.index` is used for fast similarity searches to retrieve relevant document chunks.
- The `meta.sqlite` database allows the system to look up the original text and source of a retrieved chunk.
