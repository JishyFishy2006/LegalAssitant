Furthermore, it has come to light that these agencies are not in compliance with the guidelines established under the Metro 2 credit reporting framework.

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above-named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you regarding the following account numbers : *SEE ATTACHED DOC** Please provide me with : 1. What the money you say I owe is for. \n2. A detailed explanation of how you calculated what you say I owe. \n3. Copies of any and all papers that prove I agreed to pay what you say I owe. \n4. A verification or copy of any judgment, if applicable. \n5. The identity, name, and address of the original creditor. \n6. Proof that the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account. \n7.

Your license numbers and Registered Agent or Agent of Service. \n\nAt this time, I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX or XXXX ) this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent, I will not hesitate to bring legal action against you for the following : 1. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act 2. Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act 3. Defamation of Character If your offices can provide proper documentation as requested in the following Declaration, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. \nAlso, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit. This includes listing any information with a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate, when in fact there is no provided proof that it is accurate. If your company fails to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit report and a copy of such deletion ( to any/all of the 3 major credit reporting bureaus : XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ) request shall be sent to me immediately.

It is a daily struggle to navigate financial matters with the weight of these errors and discrepancies. \n\nI implore the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene and enforce the legal provisions that safeguard consumers like myself. I am requesting the following actions : Conduct a thorough investigation into each of the violations mentioned above. \nEnsure that the creditor provides documented verification of the accounts in question. \nEnforce the relevant provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) to rectify the inaccuracies and unauthorized inquiries promptly. \nIn cases where the accounts can not be verified, require the creditors to remove these unverified accounts from my credit report. \nYour intervention in this matter is paramount, as it will not only alleviate the emotional and financial distress I have endured but also set a precedent for the fair and accurate treatment of all consumers who face similar challenges. \n\nI appreciate your attention to this matter and eagerly await a resolution that upholds the principles of justice and consumer protection. Please feel free to contact me at [ Your Phone Number ] or [ Your Email Address ] should you require any additional information. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX","date_sent_to_company":"2023-08-24T12:00:00-05:00","issue":"Incorrect information on your report","sub_product":"Credit reporting","zip_code":"85138","tags":null,"has_narrative":true,"complaint_id":"7453538","timely":"Yes","consumer_consent_provided":"Consent provided","company_response":"Closed with non-monetary relief","submitted_via":"Web","company":"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.","date_received":"2023-08-24T12:00:00-05:00","state":"AZ","consumer_disputed":"N/A","company_public_response":"Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","sub_issue":"Account information incorrect"},"sort":[1692896400000,"7453538"]},{"_index":"complaint-public-v2","_type":"_doc","_id":"7453536","_score":null,"_source":{"product":"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","complaint_what_happened":"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/2021 The collection company of the creditor has not responded, the company has to remove the debt.
