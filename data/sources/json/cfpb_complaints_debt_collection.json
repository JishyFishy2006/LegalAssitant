I want to file a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. We have been XXXX XXXX for over 35+ years and pay annual assessment fees due in XXXX of each calendar year. For some reason, we did not receive an invoice for the XXXX year. XXXX never sent a reminder notice for the payment owed. Instead, they sent us to collections.

I am outraged that XXXX was unwilling to take our past history into account and make a 1 x exception before referring our file to collections. \nI contacted XXXX and spoke to a representative. She was not interested in working with us. The representative stated that after 90 days of overdue payments, our file is sent to Pinnacle for collections. I asked her if there was a way to receive electronic notifications, and she stated that they do not have that capability and that all notices are sent USPS. I also noted that we did not receive a reminder notice .. She stated that we should know that payments are due every XXXX and that they have over XXXX owners and they do not contact owners personally regarding overdue payments and noted that there was nothing she could do and basically \" too bad ''.. I was furious that this is how they treat XXXX owners.... I contacted Pinnacle to see if they could offer any assistance. How are they allowed to charge about a 40 % fee???? There was no language on how fees are calculated. I never received the annual invoice from XXXX, and they should not solely rely on USPS to deliver notifications to owners. I do not feel that there was a need to send an owner of 35+ years to collections and want to dispute the collection fee..","date_sent_to_company":"2025-07-30T12:00:00-05:00","issue":"Written notification about debt","sub_product":"Other debt","zip_code":"11358","tags":null,"has_narrative":true,"complaint_id":"14983873","timely":"Yes","consumer_consent_provided":"Consent provided","company_response":"Closed with monetary relief","submitted_via":"Web","company":"PINNACLE RECOVERY, INC.","date_received":"2025-07-30T12:00:00-05:00","state":"NY","consumer_disputed":"N/A","company_public_response":"Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","sub_issue":"Didn't receive notice of right to dispute"},"sort":[1753894800000,"14983873"]},{"_index":"complaint-public-v2","_type":"_doc","_id":"14981495","_score":null,"_source":{"product":"Debt collection","complaint_what_happened":"XXXX XXXX my car was repossessed without my knowledge of this taking place","date_sent_to_company":"2025-07-30T12:00:00-05:00","issue":"Written notification about debt","sub_product":"Auto debt","zip_code":"63303","tags":null,"has_narrative":true,"complaint_id":"14981495","timely":"Yes","consumer_consent_provided":"Consent provided","company_response":"Closed with explanation","submitted_via":"Web","company":"CREDIT ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION","date_received":"2025-07-30T12:00:00-05:00","state":"MO","consumer_disputed":"N/A","company_public_response":"Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","sub_issue":"Didn't receive notice of right to dispute"},"sort":[1753894800000,"14981495"]},{"_index":"complaint-public-v2","_type":"_doc","_id":"14980450","_score":null,"_source":{"product":"Debt collection","complaint_what_happened":"I switched from XXXX to a new phone provider on XX/XX/XXXX.

This is a direct violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1692e ), which prohibits false, deceptive, or misleading representations in connection with the collection of any debt, including misrepresenting the legal status of the debt. \nAdditionally, per 15 U.S.C. 1692g, I request full validation of this alleged debt, including a detailed breakdown of the charges, proof of the original return, and confirmation of the decision made by the credit card issuer.\n\nThis situation has caused me undue stress and raises serious concerns about debt buyer practices, inaccurate reporting, and double collection after a legally resolved dispute. I respectfully request the CFPB to investigate this matter and ensure that the debt is permanently removed, and that no derogatory information is reported to the credit bureaus as a result of this error. \nThank you for your time and consideration.","date_sent_to_company":"2025-07-29T12:00:00-05:00","issue":"Attempts to collect debt not owed","sub_product":"I do not know","zip_code":"20743","tags":"Servicemember","has_narrative":true,"complaint_id":"14953823","timely":"Yes","consumer_consent_provided":"Consent provided","company_response":"Closed with explanation","submitted_via":"Web","company":"TRANSWORLD SYSTEMS INC","date_received":"2025-07-29T12:00:00-05:00","state":"MD","consumer_disputed":"N/A","company_public_response":"Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","sub_issue":"Debt was paid"},"sort":[1753808400000,"14953823"]},{"_index":"complaint-public-v2","_type":"_doc","_id":"14953253","_score":null,"_source":{"product":"Debt collection","complaint_what_happened":"Recently found a debt collection from TEKS on my credit report showing a debt of {$500.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX Never received any written, phone calls or any other notice of said debt.

I have no relationship with the alleged debt, and I have never banked with XXXX XXXX in any capacity. As of today, I have filed an official Identity Theft Report with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), which is enclosed and legally supersedes any claim you attempt to assert.\n\nLet me make one thing abundantly clear : you are not authorized to contact any third party on my behalf, nor is any mailing to former addresses, family members, or any third-party contact valid. I am not in contact with any member of my family, and frankly, that is none of your business. Your actions are not just offensivethey are unlawful. The moment you called my family member and disclosed any information related to a debt, you violated FDCPA 805 ( b ). There are no exceptions here, and your violations are now a matter of federal record. I will not entertain excuses, deflections, or gaslighting responses attempting to justify your actions. The FTC report overrides everything you have to sayyour compliance narratives are meaningless in the face of federal documentation and statutory rights. \n\nXXXX, your own compliance track record speaks volumes. In XXXX, XXXX levied the largest civil penalty in its history $ XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX for systemic and sustained violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. You entered a four-year monitorship agreement as a result. In early XXXX, you paid another $ XXXX related to anti-money-laundering failures.

Your XXXX  acquisition of XXXX XXXX failed due to unresolved federal scrutiny, and your board continues to churn under consent orders and criminal investigations. XXXX  entire pattern of behavior mirrors the failures that earned XXXX XXXX record-setting penalties for XXXX. Your institutions claim to regulatory credibility is laughable. \n\nFurthermore, let me be unequivocally clear : if XXXX XXXX  or any representative attempts to delay resolution by contacting me under the guise of needing more information or confirming account details, you will be ignored. I will not supply personal identifying information, account data, or anything elsebecause I do not recognize this account, and I have never opened or used a XXXX XXXX  credit card in my life. I owe you no duty to investigate your records on your behalf. The burden of proof lies solely with you, and any attempt to reverse that obligation will be construed as bad faith and intentional stalling. Under FDCPA 809 ( b ), I have a right to dispute a debt without being coerced into participating in your internal fact-finding. I do not know this debt. I do not recognize it. And I am not afraid of any further unlawful pressure. Attempting to drag this out or shift responsibility will only escalate your liability. \n\nAs for Admin Recovery, your call to my family member is indefensible and constitutes a clear FDCPA violation. You are hereby ordered to cease and desist all collection activity, unless and until you provide all of the following : ( 1 ) a copy of the original signed contract bearing my signature, ( 2 ) the complete and verifiable chain of title from XXXX XXXX  through every assignee, ( 3 ) a full account history from day one, and ( 4 ) a notarized affidavit from a custodian of records with personal knowledge and legal authority.

The apartment management accepted this offer and provided a written settlement letter confirming the revised balance. However, due to a delay on my part in returning the signed agreement, the apartment forwarded the full ( disputed ) balance to Fair Collections & Outsourcing ( FCO ) for collection. \n\nAfter learning the account had been sent to collections, I contacted the apartment management again to reiterate my willingness to pay the agreed-upon {$300.00}. They advised me to wait for a call from the collection agency. Unfortunately, I never received any communication from FCO. \n\nI first became aware of the collection account only when it appeared on my credit report in late XXXX XXXX XXXX months after the account was reportedly opened in XX/XX/XXXX. The reporting included an incomplete account number and an incorrect business address, which differed from the one later used in FCOs correspondence. I had not received any prior notice or debt validation before this negative report appeared. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a debt validation request via certified mail requesting : A detailed breakdown of the total amount claimed and how it was calculated The full name and contact information of the original creditor A copy of the original lease agreement and any itemized list of damages or charges claimed Proof that FCO was authorized to collect the debt, including the chain of assignment FCO responded only after receiving this request by providing a copy of the lease agreement and a resident ledger. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a formal dispute letter to FCO, which included : A copy of the original settlement letter from the apartment manager Documentation showing that several charges ( e.g., carpet replacement fees ) had been cancelled In that letter, I stated that I was willing to pay the {$300.00} immediately, contingent upon written confirmation that : The {$300.00} payment would be accepted as payment in full The collection account would be deleted from credit reports ( pay-for-delete ) Despite these efforts, FCO removed the dispute status on XX/XX/XXXX, re-verified the full original balance, and continued reporting the account without notifying me or allowing time to respond. This action caused a significant drop in my credit score. \nOn that same day, I received a call from an FCO agent asking how I planned to pay the balance. I asked her to thoroughly review the documents I had already sent multiple timesdelays that occurred due to FCOs use of an incorrect address and internal routing issues ( documented by certified mail and return receipts ). The agent consulted with her manager and then informed me that the case was now under active investigation, and I should expect a response within XXXX days.\n\nHowever, despite that statement, FCO updated the account status to unpaid that same daybefore completing the investigation or receiving any response from me. \n\nJust XXXX business days later, the same agent called again and stated that the original creditor refused to honor the prior {$300.00} settlement and asked how I wished to proceed. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received XXXX written response stating : This office received your dispute and pursuant to our obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act has conducted an investigation of your account. We have found the account to be reported correctly and will continue to report it... \n\nThis letter failed to address any of the supporting documentation I had previously submittedsuch as the settlement agreement, the cancellation of certain charges, or the communication history. Instead, it simply reaffirmed their reporting position and warned that they were not required to respond to multiple identical requests. \n\nIn response, I sent a detailed follow-up letter ( included with this complaint ), in which I stated : I am writing in follow-up to your letter regarding Account # XXXX, which was originally related to a disputed balance from my previous apartment residence. I acknowledge receipt of your response stating that the account has been reported correctly following your investigation. However, I respectfully disagree with the conclusion of your review and am requesting further reconsideration in light of important facts In that letter, I reiterated that the apartment had accepted my {$300.00} settlement offer ( which I still intended to pay ), requested a pay-for-delete arrangement, and asked for reporting to be paused during review. I also pointed out that FCO never provided documentation to justify certain charges, such as carpet replacement fees incurred after I vacated the unit.\n\nTo date, FCO has failed to : Properly validate the debt Acknowledge the previously agreed {$300.00} settlement Report the account accurately Provide fair notice or time to respond before materially altering the reporting status I remain committed to resolving this matter and request a fair review, correction of inaccurate credit reporting, and acknowledgment of the original settlement terms. My outreach has been consistent, documented, and made in good faith.","date_sent_to_company":"2025-07-28T12:00:00-05:00","issue":"False statements or representation","sub_product":"Rental debt","zip_code":"48306","tags":null,"has_narrative":true,"complaint_id":"14925916","timely":"Yes","consumer_consent_provided":"Consent provided","company_response":"Closed with explanation","submitted_via":"Web","company":"FAIR COLLECTIONS & OUTSOURCING, INC.","date_received":"2025-07-28T12:00:00-05:00","state":"MI","consumer_disputed":"N/A","company_public_response":"Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","sub_issue":"Attempted to collect wrong amount"},"sort":[1753722000000,"14925916"]},{"_index":"complaint-public-v2","_type":"_doc","_id":"14924842","_score":null,"_source":{"product":"Debt collection","complaint_what_happened":"This happened between me and cox communication.
