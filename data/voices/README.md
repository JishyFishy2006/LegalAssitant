# Voices Directory

This directory stores the pre-trained text-to-speech (TTS) models.

## Expected Files:
- TTS model files (e.g., `.onnx` for Piper TTS)
- Model configuration files (e.g., `.json`)

## Example (Piper TTS):
- `en_US-lessac-medium.onnx`
- `en_US-lessac-medium.onnx.json`

## Generation:
- These files should be downloaded from a TTS model provider (e.g., Piper TTS models on Hugging Face).
- They are not generated by this project's scripts.

## Purpose:
- The TTS models are used by the `tts_piper.py` node to convert the LLM's text response into audio.
